La Rayb is an early-stage **digital logic simulator** project that aims to facilitate the designing of complex logical systems.
It is perfect at educational uses, and sucks at professional uses.

This project is inspired by [Sebastian Lague's digital logic simulator.](https://github.com/SebLague/Digital-Logic-Sim)
